MiscTools is a collection of small UNIX utilities that are fairly trivial
but nevertheless useful. These include a binary dump program, a directory
browser/selector, a file truncator, an ASCII-code lookup utility, a program
for printing fortunes, a curses-based terminal lock program, and a few others.

This requires cbase.
