SASH - a stand-alone shell with many built-in commands

The sash program is a stand-alone shell which is useful for recovering
from certain types of system failures.  In particular, it was created
in order to cope with the problem of missing shared libraries or important 
executables.

Sash can execute external programs, as in any shell.  There are no
restrictions on these commands, as the standard shell is used to execute 
them if there are any non-wildcard meta-characters in the command.
More importantly, however, is that many of the standard system commands
are built-in to sash.

In addition, a simple shell variable expansion support has been added, e.g.
the variable "$(VAR)" is replaced by the content of the variable "VAR".
